	abstract = {In 2007, the apparent increase in the number of harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) stranding along the central California coast compared to the number of strandings the previous year resulted in the declaration of an Unusual Mortality Event by the National Marine Fisheries Service. A statistically significant increase in strandings occurred in 2008 and 2009, with more than twice the mean annual number of strandings documented per year in the previous decade occurring each year, but then strandings decreased in 2010. No single cause of mortality explained all the strandings, and there were no significant changes in age class or sex of strandings in 2008 and 2009. Trauma, including interspecific aggression and fisheries interactions, was the most common cause of death, and blunt force trauma increased significantly in August through October of 2008 and 2009. Domoic acid toxicosis was documented for the first time in this species. Although the cause of death for many strandings was unidentified, the increase in strandings in 2008-2009 reflects an increase in blunt trauma rather than an epizootic of disease.},

Despite being salmon specialists, individuals from all three killer whale pods (J, K, L) have been observed harassing and killing porpoises (family Phocoenidae) without consuming them. Retrospectively, we identified and analyzed 78 episodes of Southern Resident killer whales harassing porpoises between 1962 and 2020, of which 28 resulted in the porpoise's death (“phocoenacide”). Fifty-six episodes involved harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), 13 involved Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli), and the porpoise species was unreported for nine episodes. Southern Resident killer whales often targeted young porpoises that were similar in size to adult Chinook salmon.},

	abstract = {Understanding spatiotemporally varying animal distributions can inform ecological understanding of species' behavior (e.g., foraging and predator/prey interactions) and support development of management and conservation measures. Data from an array of echolocation-click detectors (C-PODs) were analyzed using Bayesian spatiotemporal modeling to investigate spatial and temporal variation in occurrence and foraging activity of harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) and how this variation was influenced by daylight and presence of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). The probability of occurrence of porpoises was highest on an offshore sandbank, where the proportion of detections with foraging clicks was relatively low. The porpoises' overall distribution shifted throughout the summer and autumn, likely influenced by seasonal prey availability. Probability of porpoise occurrence was lowest in areas close to the coast, where dolphin detections were highest and declined prior to dolphin detection, leading potentially to avoidance of spatiotemporal overlap between porpoises and dolphins.},

	abstract = {Background: Aggressive interactions between bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) have been reported in different parts of the world since the late 1990s. In the Baltic Sea, harbor porpoises are the only native cetacean species, while bottlenose dolphins may appear there temporarily. In the fall of 2016, a solitary male photo-identified bottlenose dolphin stayed in the German Baltic Sea of SchleswigHolstein for 3 months. During that time, the necropsies of the stranded harbor porpoises revealed types of trauma of varying degrees in six animals, which is unusual in this area. The purpose of this study was to determine if the appearance of the bottlenose dolphin could be linked to the trauma of the harbor porpoise carcasses.
Results: Pathological findings in these animals included subcutaneous, thoracic and abdominal hemorrhages, multiple, mainly bilateral, rib fractures, and one instance of lung laceration. These findings correspond with the previously reported dolphin-caused injuries in other regions. Moreover, public sighting reports showed a spatial and temporal correlation between the appearance of the dolphin and the stranding of fatally injured harbor porpoises.
Conclusion: Despite the fact that no attack has been witnessed in German waters to date, our findings indicate the first record of lethal interactions between a bottlenose dolphin and harbor porpoises in the German Baltic Sea. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this is the first report of porpoise aggression by a socially isolated bottlenose dolphin.},

	abstract = {Between 2007 and 2009, we witnessed three aggressive interactions between harbor porpoises and bottlenose dolphins in Monterey Bay, California. This is the ﬁrst time such aggression has been documented in the Paciﬁc, and the ﬁrst time a harbor porpoise was collected immediately after witnessing its death, inﬂicted by bottlenose dolphins. Of the bottlenose dolphins present, 92\% were males either conﬁrmed (61\%) or putative (31\%). Since 2005, 44 harbor porpoise deaths inﬂicted by bottlenose dolphins were documented in California. Aberrant behavior was rejected as a cause of aggression, based on widespread documentation of similar behaviors in other populations of free-ranging bottlenose dolphins. The evidence for interspecies territoriality as a form of competition for prey was weak: there is little dietary overlap and there are differences in bottlenose dolphin and harbor porpoise distribution patterns in California. Object-oriented play was plausible as a form of practice to maintain intraspeciﬁc infanticidal skills or a form of play to maintain ﬁghting skills between male associates. Contributing factors could be high-testosterone levels, as attacks occurred at the height of the breeding season, and/or a skewed operational sex ratio. Ultimately, we need more information about bottlenose dolphin social structure at the time of the aggression.},

	abstract = {Harbor porpoises, Phocoena phocoena, off California, comprise four recognized population stocks: Morro Bay (MOR), Monterey Bay (MRY), San Francisco-Russian River (SFRR), and Northern California-Southern Oregon (NCSO). The three southernmost stocks experienced substantial bycatch in gill net fisheries during the 1970s and 1980s. While the SFRR stock received full protection from gill nets in 1989, the MOR and MRY stocks continued to experience at least some bycatch through 2001–2002. We examined long-term population trends for these four harbor porpoise stocks, based on two sets of systematic, aerial line-transect surveys conducted off California during summer/fall of 1986–2017. We applied a Bayesian hierarchical framework to specify a process model of population density and an observation model of porpoise counts during line-transect surveys. Growth rates were estimated for periods with and without bycatch. Posterior distributions indicate the MOR, MRY, and SFRR stocks, respectively, grew at 9.6\%, 5.8\%, and 6.1\% per year after gill nets were largely or fully eliminated for each stock. Abundance off northern California appears stable or slightly increasing. This study provides a first empirical estimate of maximum net reproductive rate for harbor porpoise (at least 9.6\%), and demonstrates that porpoise populations can recover from substantial gill net impacts if bycatch is eliminated.},
